All Locks & Dams Upstream of Peoria on the Illinois Waterway
The Illinois Waterway has 8 locks and dams total. We will prioritize tributary water systems and locks and dams upstream of peoria while we build the minimum viable product for this experiment, though as our research progresses we may add in more downstream sites before expanding into other risk categories, as downstream blockage can change the flood model depending on how much water the upstream flood plains are already holding, which is a data set we are still unsure of how to utilize, as of yet.

| # | Lock & Dam | Location | River Mile (above Mississippi) | Notes |
|---|------------|----------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Starved Rock L&D | Near Utica/Ottawa, IL | ~231 | Closest major upstream structure; very relevant to Peoria flood timing |
| 2 | Marseilles L&D | Marseilles, IL | ~244 | Marseilles Canal bypasses the dam; large Tainter gate structure |
| 3 | Dresden Island L&D | Morris, IL | ~271 | Where the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers join to form the Illinois |
| 4 | Brandon Road L&D | Joliet, IL | ~286 | Controls flow from the Chicago metro area |
| 5 | Lockport L&D | Lockport, IL | ~291 | On the Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal; critical chokepoint for Chicago-area releases |
| 6 | T.J. O'Brien L&D | Chicago (Calumet River) | ~326 | Controls Lake Michigan inflow to the system |

These six locks and dams between Peoria and Lake Michigan. 

Dresden Island is particularly important because it sits at the confluence of the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers — this is where the Illinois River is effectively born. High flow readings here may indicate relatively early warning of future downstream conditions.

Lockport and Brandon Road are the gauges most closely affected by the Chicago metro area. MWRD releases during heavy rain events can meaningfully spike flows downstream, and these two locks will have evidence of this signature first.

Starved Rock is the last early-warning point before water reaches us — at typical flow velocities, a flood pulse from Starved Rock can reach Peoria in roughly 24–48 hours depending on conditions, giving us meaningful lead time to enact actionable steps for flood damage mitigation and evacuation.



On the dam types: Peoria and LaGrange (downstream of you) use the older wicket dam design, which gets laid flat during high flows — meaning the dam essentially disappears during flood events and the river runs as open water. The upstream locks use fixed concrete gated structures with Tainter gates. This matters for your service because the Corps' operational decisions at each structure affect pool levels.
For USGS gauge pairings with each of these, the agency typically places gauges just above or below each lock. The USGS NWIS site search at waterservices.usgs.gov filtered to Illinois and the Illinois River will show you all active stations you can map to these structures.




To Do:
-------
 - determine polling frequency and schedule
 - prepare database (postgres?)
 - set up vps
 - determine alert infrastructure?
 - describe dashboard interface
